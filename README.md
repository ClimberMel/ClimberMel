### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**ClimberMel/ClimberMel** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating tools for Interactive Brokers using python and ib_insync
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python and tkinter
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ib_insync and trading software
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ib_insync, asyncio and using classes
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about python or tkinter
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: here or discord ClimberMel's ib_insync server
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: anything but Mister... makes me feel old!
- âš¡ Fun fact: On average a stock market correction happens every 2 years.  Last one was Mar 2020...
